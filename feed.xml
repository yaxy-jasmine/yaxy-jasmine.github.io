Well, let’s see: inflation, gas prices – wait, even Disney prices? It feels like the universe is playing a cruel game of “How high can we go?” and forgot to hit the brakes, leaving nothing untouched. Even the “happiest place on earth” isn’t immune, and the price tag for a Disney vacation paints a pretty clear picture. The magic isn’t gone, but it’s certainly more expensive. Now you need a small fortune just to afford the privilege of waiting in line for overpriced churros!</p> <p>This summer, I decided to take the plunge and visit the infamous Disneyland. Let me tell you, it was like stepping into a fairy tale—if that fairy tale came with a price tag that could make Cinderella faint. As soon as I entered the park, I decided to grab lunch, and it felt like I had to trade a kidney for a grilled cheese and tomato soup. The worst part? It wasn’t even good! I felt queasy for at least half an hour after that atrocious meal.</p> <p>And then there were the lines. Waiting for rides at Disney is like playing a game of “Will it ever end?” Even after I finally caved and bought the Genie pass, I barely managed to get on any rides all day. On the bright side, I did get to experience the magic—just in the form of the magical emptying of my bank account. Yet, despite all my complaints, Disney die-hards keep coming back. So, if I had another chance to go to Disney, would I ? Absolutely! It’s a love-hate relationship that continues to thrive, even if it now costs a small fortune to experience that famous Disney magic.</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="writing"/><category term="writing"/><category term="volunteer"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[format of md post]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">NYT - The Founders Saw This Insane Political Moment Coming 237 Years Ago</title><link href="https://yaxy-jasmine.github.io/blog/2024/NYT4/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="NYT - The Founders Saw This Insane Political Moment Coming 237 Years Ago"/><published>2024-07-23T09:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2024-07-23T09:00:00+00:00</updated><id>https://yaxy-jasmine.github.io/blog/2024/NYT4</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://yaxy-jasmine.github.io/blog/2024/NYT4/"><![CDATA[<h3 id="the-founders-saw-this-insane-political-moment-coming-237-years-ago">The Founders Saw This Insane Political Moment Coming 237 Years Ago</h3> <p>While reading the NYT today, I was both surprised and excited. Having just endured a long APUSH class discussing the origins of America and its government, this article was a real eye-opener for me. Ever wondered if today’s political chaos could be traced back to a sweltering summer in Philadelphia 237 years ago? This article - covers it all! Imagine the delegates, drenched in sweat and heatedly (haha get it?) debating whether the president should serve for life or just one term, all while Hamilton suggests turning the office into some kind of elective monarchy.</p> <p>This article highlights the Founders’ anxieties about the presidency—whether it was fears of monarchy or corruption—are just as relevant today. . For instance, the current political polarization and power struggles bear a striking resemblance to the debates in Philadelphia back then.The parallels between their historical struggles and our current political turbulence are both enlightening and entertaining. Many say history doesn’t repeat itself, but it does rhyme, and this saying fits perfectly into this scenario.</p> <p>I think it’s incredible the Constitution is still alive and kicking after all these years. The amount of foresight required for that is incredible, being able to set guidelines for a whole country that will still apply years into the future. Just imagine doing that today! I can’t even imagine what the world would be like ten years from now, much less hundreds of years into the future. For all I know, the world could end tomorrow!</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="writing"/><category term="writing"/><category term="volunteer"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[format of md post]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">NYT - Paris mayor swims in Seine River amid E. coli bacteria concerns ahead of Olympics</title><link href="https://yaxy-jasmine.github.io/blog/2024/NYT3/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="NYT - Paris mayor swims in Seine River amid E. coli bacteria concerns ahead of Olympics"/><published>2024-07-21T09:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2024-07-21T09:00:00+00:00</updated><id>https://yaxy-jasmine.github.io/blog/2024/NYT3</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://yaxy-jasmine.github.io/blog/2024/NYT3/"><![CDATA[<h3 id="paris-mayor-swims-in-seine-river-amid-e-coli-bacteria-concerns-ahead-of-olympics">Paris mayor swims in Seine River amid E. coli bacteria concerns ahead of Olympics</h3> <p>As the Paris Olympics rapidly approach,the topic of safety has gradually made its way into the spotlight. When I first heard about the project to clean the Seine, it was still in its early stages. Honestly, I was both amazed and incredibly dubious on whether it could be done by the summer, given the task of cleaning decades of pollution in such a short amount of time. However, when I saw a NYT article about the mayor taking a dive into the Seine,I thought the efforts had been successful! After all, if the mayor can swim in it “safely”, why shouldn’t everyone be able to? A few days later, I came across numerous articles discussing the amount of remaining bacteria, including E. coli, in the waters. This was shocking, as many like me could have seen the initial article and remained unaware of the true circumstances. By allowing the mayor to go in the water, a false sense of safety is created for the public, and allowing the athletes to swim in it is dangerous and irresponsible. In my opinion, it’s always better to be safe than sorry, and if an outbreak of E. coli does occur during the games, it would be disastrous, and France would undoubtedly be held responsible. The games can certainly proceed if France selects a different, safer location. I don’t think it’s too late to make this change to prioritize the athletes’ safety above all else.</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="writing"/><category term="writing"/><category term="volunteer"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[format of md post]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">NYT - Before the Olympics</title><link href="https://yaxy-jasmine.github.io/blog/2024/NYT2/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="NYT - Before the Olympics"/><published>2024-07-20T09:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2024-07-20T09:00:00+00:00</updated><id>https://yaxy-jasmine.github.io/blog/2024/NYT2</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://yaxy-jasmine.github.io/blog/2024/NYT2/"><![CDATA[<h3 id="before-the-olympics-the-fabulous-french-fashion-flex">Before the Olympics, the Fabulous French Fashion Flex</h3> <p>My recent readings have centered around the topics of the Olympics in France this year. After listening to my French teacher passionately lecture for a full two weeks on “Les jeux olympiques,” I have learned that France has really gone above and beyond for this event, and it’s incredible to see how they incorporated so many aspects of their culture and landmarks into it. They even went so far as to clean out the entire Seine for the Olympic swimming competitions! Their adorable mascot is designed off of the Phrygian cap, which has been a symbol of freedom throughout French history, spreading French culture and values to the rest of the world through unique and captivating methods.</p> <p>That is why I was so intrigued when I saw the fashion trends of France and how they managed to show that off before the Olympics. In the past, I’ve seen enough negative comments online about fashion being outrageously ridiculous to not hold high hopes for this article. This article showed me that, much like many contemporary art pieces, fashion has meanings behind it and often provides commentary on many aspects of life. While many may mention the impracticality of these clothes, this art form represents French designers’ creativity. Much like the mascot representing ideas of France, the artistic design of the clothing created in France shares culture in similar ways. In a unique time such as the Olympics, fashion, as an icon of France, is an effective way to bring together many different countries with diverse cultures, much like other forms of art. Therefore, while many see the Olympics to be a competition among countries around the world, unity plays a much larger role in representing the true, intended spirit of the Olympics. This summer in Paris, fashion and art will find their way into creating such unity.</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="writing"/><category term="writing"/><category term="volunteer"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[format of md post]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">NYT - Welcome Back, Pandas</title><link href="https://yaxy-jasmine.github.io/blog/2024/NYT1/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="NYT - Welcome Back, Pandas"/><published>2024-07-01T09:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2024-07-01T09:00:00+00:00</updated><id>https://yaxy-jasmine.github.io/blog/2024/NYT1</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://yaxy-jasmine.github.io/blog/2024/NYT1/"><![CDATA[<h3 id="welcome-back-pandas-two-furry-diplomats-are-headed-to-the-dc-zoo">Welcome Back, Pandas! Two Furry Diplomats Are Headed to the D.C. Zoo.</h3> <p>Imagine being uprooted from your home, and then transported across the world to serve as a symbol of diplomatic goodwill. This is the reality faced by two pandas, Bao Li and Qing Bao, who are set to be relocated from China to the US. However, using pandas as tokens to mend international relations raises serious ethical concerns. While they may be treated well in their new home, are all the hassle and isolation from their species worth it? Pandas could be living their best life at home if humans hadn’t decided to relocate them halfway across the world. Animals don’t speak for themselves, but if we put ourselves in the panda’s place, would we be content being trapped in a cage all our lives? Even with family and friends, will you be ok to be moved to a place far from everything you have known?</p> <p>Now, consider that this change wasn’t even made due to a necessity, but due to a greater reason far beyond you. Studies have shown that animals display behavior similar to humans in many ways, and mental health issues do exist among other creatures. With our limited knowledge on animals, such as Pandas, is it really necessary to move them around like toys on a whim? We must question the ethics of using living beings as tools for political gain. Relocating pandas for diplomatic purposes prioritizes spectacle over the animals’ well-being, and it might not be the right thing to do.</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="writings"/><category term="writing"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[format of md post]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Travels</title><link href="https://yaxy-jasmine.github.io/blog/2024/travel-pics/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Travels"/><published>2024-01-10T20:51:16+00:00</published><updated>2024-01-10T20:51:16+00:00</updated><id>https://yaxy-jasmine.github.io/blog/2024/travel-pics</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://yaxy-jasmine.github.io/blog/2024/travel-pics/"><![CDATA[<p>Travels.</p> <div class="row mt-3"> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" media="(max-width: 480px)" srcset="/assets/img/IMG_0810-480.webp"/> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" media="(max-width: 800px)" srcset="/assets/img/IMG_0810-800.webp"/> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" media="(max-width: 1400px)" srcset="/assets/img/IMG_0810-1400.webp"/> <img src="/assets/img/IMG_0810.jpg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="auto" height="auto" data-zoomable="" onerror="this.onerror=null;
